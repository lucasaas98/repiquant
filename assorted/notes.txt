Idea:

We show the "picture" of the world around us by adding data points, firstly we will do with: Support, Resistance, EMA, VWAP, MACD, RSI, Previous Close, Previous Open, Previous High, Previous Low, LinReg of Close values.
Initially we will have 4 order types. 3 longs and a NoOp:
    - NoOp - we should not do anything at this point
    - Small Long - we will make money on a 1.5/1 risk/reward ratio
    - Medium Long - We will make money on a 3/1 risk/reward ratio
    - Mega Long - We will make money on a 5/1 risk/reward ratio
At any bar we need to take the "picture" and calculate how much we would make with each of the order type.
This will allow us to classify each bar by its best order type. Meaning we have a dataset we can then train for classification. 
We will need to do this on multiple tickers from the same market. And we should create different models for different markets - the model that works on stocks probably won't work on FX.

Modifiables:
- The picture can change for the data, meaning we can add or remove variables as we see fit. 
- We can add more order types, especially special ones like trailing stop loss and even options.
- The frequency, we can check if being on the 1 minute bar is more useful than 5 or 30 minute or day
